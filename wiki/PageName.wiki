#div-src v1.1 released.

= Tighter error checking =

The JavaScript code is enhanced with a check to see if the user has opened an HTML page from a file system rather than from a web server.  AJAX can't work against a bald file system, causing div-src to fail.  A new check reports this problem if found, and exits.
